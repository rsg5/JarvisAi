This marks the inception of my inaugural repository, housing Python code tailored for crafting a Voice Assistant named JARVIS. Due to financial constraints, I haven't integrated any AI API keys. Nonetheless, the assistant is equipped with features to access Google and Wikipedia for fetching information on specific topics. Additionally, it's programmed with logic to retrieve applications, websites, songs, and provide the current time. The assistant will only respond upon being called by its name and will greet you according to the time of day. Moreover, I've added the functionality to send messages to a particular contact or a group in WhatsApp, or email a specific person using my assistant.

I've also left room to implement a feature for sending images to contacts or groups via WhatsApp using JARVIS. While it's possible for someone to develop that functionality, I feel it's not quite typical to send images via voice control.

This foundational code for a voice assistant AI is the initial step in my journey. It's basic yet robust, offering essential features. I intentionally kept it simple to lay a strong foundation. As I progress, I'll explore adding more advanced capabilities and enhancing the user experience. Beginning with this basic setup allows for gradual expansion and improvement of the assistant over time.
