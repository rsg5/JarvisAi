This marks the inception of my first repository, housing Python code tailored for crafting a Voice Assistant named JARVIS. Due to financial constraints (I'm broke!), I haven't integrated any AI API keys. However, the assistant is equipped with features to access Google and Wikipedia for fetching information on specific topics. Additionally, it's programmed with logic to fetch applications, websites, and songs. Notably, it can also provide the current time. The assistant will only respond upon being called by its name and will greet you according to the time of day. Please note that I've intentionally referred to "Pie Chart" instead of "PyCharm" due to recognition issues.

This foundational code for a voice assistant AI is just what I've started with. It's basic but sturdy, providing essential features. I intentionally kept it simple to begin with, focusing on building a solid base. As I continue to develop it, I'll explore adding more advanced capabilities and enhancing the user experience. Starting from this basic setup allows me to gradually expand and improve the assistant over time.
